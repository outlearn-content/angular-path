# Angular Style Guide

If you want something specific done in Angular, there are plenty of different ways to do so. Some of them are plain bad but there are also several good ways to write and organize your code. If you have a team working on an Angular project together, it will be hugely helpful for you to agree on a joint style guide. The next Module shows a great example from Todd Motto that you can use as it is or as a starting point for developing your own.

Do it with style!

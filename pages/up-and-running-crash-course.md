# Up and Running with an App

Ever wondered how quickly you could write a functional app? Here's an example that takes less than 10-minutes. Sure, it's pretty fast typing but it highlights how simple the basics of Angular are. To get the most out of the example, go ahead and build the same or similar app right along, pausing the video when needed.

Happy coding!
